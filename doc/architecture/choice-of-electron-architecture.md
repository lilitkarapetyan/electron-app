# Delivery of application via Electron

## Status

Proposed 

## Context

Our client only requires a desktop application.

But, while Ian has extensive experience in the development of desktop applications, most current development tooling centers around the browser.

It would also be useful to develop as much of the application as possible using browser technologies, so that we can develop skills and libraries that will be used for similar applications delivered via a browser in the future.

## Decision

Develop application using Electron framework, but aim to use standard browser technologies as much as possible.

## Consequences

- Potentially increase in tech stack & complexity compared to standard desktop app
- Usefully develop UI and processes that are transferrable to the browser.
